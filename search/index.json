[{"content":"This post aims to introduce how to quickly configure your VS Code installed in Host (a.k.a. local machine) to develop in Guest (i.e. remote machine, remote server, virtual machine in VirtualBox or Cloud)\nStep 1: Create a Virtual Machine (VM) Please refer to Install SEED VM on VirtualBox. Skip if you have one.\n username: seed\npassword: dees\n  VM Network panel \nFollowing figure shows how NAT Network looks like. Please refer to VirtualBox Network Settings: Complete Guide or Virtual Networking if interesed.  NAT network \nStep 2: Set Up SSH Server Service in VM ## Install sshd server sudo apt install openssh-server ## Start server and check status sudo service ssh start sudo service ssh status ## Further config sshd server only when needed # sudo vim /etc/.ssh/sshd_config # sudo service ssh restart ## Verify ssh login # tip: use `whoami` to display your username ssh seed@127.0.0.1 Step 3: Add Port Forwarding Rule in VirtualBox Go to VirtualBox/Preferences/Network, edit your NATNetwork and select Port Forwarding. Add Rules as follows.\n Name: SSH (any arbitrary unique name)\nProtocol: TCP\nHost IP: 127.0.0.1 (any available ip of your local machine)\nHost Port: 8022 (any unused port higher than 1024)\nGuest IP: 10.0.2.4 (type ifconfig in terminal of VM to check)\nGuest Port: 22 (SSH default port)\n  VirtualBox Network panel   Port forwarding rule \nStep 4: Set Up SSH Client Service in Host Install ssh client For macOS Host, it comes pre-installed. For Ubuntu Host, Debian/Ubuntu Run sudo apt-get install openssh-client. For other OS, please refer to Install a supported SSH client.\nNow you can connect VM by SSH ssh seed@127.0.0.1 -p 8022 Set up password-free login (Optional) If you want password-free login, do the following substeps in your local machine.\n# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist ll ~/.ssh # Generate new key if needed with RSA 2048⁄4096 or Ed25519 # Just don’t use ECDSA/DSA! ssh-keygen -t ed25519 # Start the ssh-agent in the background eval \u0026#34;$(ssh-agent -s)\u0026#34; # Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # Copy public key to VM ssh-copy-id seed@127.0.0.1 -p 8022 # Now try again to login with no password required ssh seed@127.0.0.1 -p 8022 Please refer to How to Set Up SSH Keys on Ubuntu 20.04 or Connecting to GitHub with SSH for more info.\nIf you want further simplify the connection, open ~/.ssh/config in your local machine and append the following ssh config.\nHost sd HostName 127.0.0.1 User seed # replace id_ed25519 with your secret key IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 Port 8022 Now try to login by\nssh sd Step 5: Install VSCode and Remote SSH Extension Install VSCode in your local machine and install Remote - SSH extension in VSCode and click the bottom left \u0026gt;\u0026lt; icon to use it. All the extensions I prefer are listed below.\n Remote\nRemote - SSH\nRemote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files\nHex\nHex Editor (or hexdump for VSCode)\nC/C++\nC/C++\nCMake\nCMake Tools\nMarkdown\nMarkdown All in One\nMarkdown Preview Enhanced\nmarkdownlint\nFormatter\nPrettier\nBracket Pair Colorizer 2\nindent-rainbow\nGit\nGitLens\nGit Graph\ngitignore\nDevelopment\nVisual Studio Intellicode\nCode Runner\n Q\u0026amp;A Q: How to beautify the terminal? A: Oh My Zsh is all you need.\n","date":"2022-01-27T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://x-zheng16.github.io/p/quickly-configure-vs-code-to-develop-in-remote-machine/","title":"Quickly Configure VS Code to Develop in Remote Machine"},{"content":"This post shows upcoming deadlines of conferences related to RL, Security and Robotics research.\nAI Conferences (Classification is based on CCF)\nA    Conf Deadline     NeurIPS2021 May 21, 2021   AAAI2022 Aug. 30, 2021   CVPR2022 Nov. 18, 2021   ICCV2022 Dec. 23, 2021   IJCAI2022 Jan. 14, 2022   ICML2022 Jan. 27, 2022    B    Conf Deadline     ICRA2022 Sept. 15, 2021   AAMAS2022 Oct. 8, 2021   ICAPS2022 Dec. 15, 2021   COLT2022 Feb. 9, 2022   ECCV2022 Mar. 7, 2022    C    Conf Deadline     AISTATS2022 Oct. 15, 2021   IJCNN2022 Jan. 31, 2022   IROS2022 Mar. 1, 2022    Security Conferences A    Conf Deadline URL     S\u0026amp;P 2023 Apr. 1, Aug. 19, Dec. 2, 2022 site   CCS 2022 Jan. 14, May 2, 2022 site   Usenix 2022 Jun. 8, Oct. 12, 2021, Feb. 1, 2022 site    B    Conf Deadline URL     ESORICS 2022 Jan. 31, May 15, 2022 site   CSF 2022 May 14th, Oct. 1st, 2021, Feb. 4, 2022 site   ACSAC 2021 Jun. 28, 2021 site   NDSS 2022 May 21, Jul. 27, 2021 site    C    Conf Deadline URL     ACNS 2022 Sept. 3, 2021, Jan. 14, 2022 site   AsiaCCS 2022 Jul. 30, Nov. 19, 2021 site    Others    Conf Deadline URL     ICLR 2022 Oct. 06, 2021 site   CoRL 2022 Jun. 15, 2022 site   RSS 2022 Jan. 28, 2022 site    Classification by Month    Month Conference     1 ICML, IJCAI, IJCNN, CCS, ESORICS, ACNS, RSS   2 COLT, Usenix, CSF   3 ECCV, IROS   4 S\u0026amp;P   5 NeurIPS, CCS, ESORICS, CSF, NDSS   6 Usenix, ACSAC, CoRL   7 NDSS, AsiaCCS   8 AAAI, S\u0026amp;P   9 ICRA, ACNS   10 AAMAS, AISTATS, Usenix, CSF, ICLR   11 CVPR, AsiaCCS   12 ICCV, ICAPS, S\u0026amp;P    ","date":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://x-zheng16.github.io/p/ai-and-security-conferences/","title":"AI and Security Conferences"}]
