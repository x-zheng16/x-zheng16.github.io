I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Hong Kong Institute of AI for Science (HKAI-Sci)](https://hkais.hk), City University of Hong Kong. My research is positioned at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning**, **Trustworthy AI**, **Generative AI**, and **Robot Learning**. I am particularly passionate about developing robust and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms to enable **Trustworthy Decision Making** in real-world systems. I have been honored to receive the prestigious [CityU Presidential PhD Scholarship](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/media/news/2020/06/16/prestigious-new-scholarships-hk156m-world-class-phd-candidates).

I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk) in 2024, under the guidance of Prof. Cong Wang. Prior to that, I earned my Master’s degree in Control Science and Engineering from the [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2019, where I was advised by [Prof. Tao Zhang](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1110/1573.htm). I hold dual Bachelor's degrees in Automation and Mathematics from the [Shen Yuan Honors College](https://hc.buaa.edu.cn) (formerly the School of Advanced Engineering) at [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn), where I graduated in 2016.
