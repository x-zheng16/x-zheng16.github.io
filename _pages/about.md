I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Cong Wang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/). I also work in close collaboration with [Dr. Xingjun Ma](http://xingjunma.com) from Fudan University and [Prof. Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/cshen/english) from Xi'an Jiaotong University. My primary research focus is on the intersection of reinforcement learning and trustworthy AI. Specifically, I am passionate about designing efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for applications such as robot learning, adversarial policy learning, and AI red teaming.

I received my Master's degree in 2019 from the [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Tao Zhang](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1110/1573.htm). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2016 from the Shen Yuan Honors College (formerly School of Advanced Engineering) at Beihang University.
