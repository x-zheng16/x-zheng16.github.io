I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Cong Wang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/) and working closely with [Dr. Xingjun Ma](http://xingjunma.com) and [Prof. Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/cshen/english). My research interests lie in the intersection of reinforcement learning and trustworthy AI. Particularly, I am interested in developing efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for robot learning, adversarial policy learning, and AI red teaming.

I received my Master degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2019, supervised by [Prof. Tao Zhang](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1110/1573.htm), and obtained my Bachelor degree from Honors College (formerly School of Advanced Engineering), Beihang University in 2016.
