I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Cong Wang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/). I also work in close collaboration with [Prof. Xingjun Ma](http://xingjunma.com) from Fudan University and [Prof. Chao Shen](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/cshen/english) from Xi'an Jiaotong University. I am a recipient of the [CityU Presidential PhD Scholarship](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/media/news/2020/06/16/prestigious-new-scholarships-hk156m-world-class-phd-candidates).

My research focuses on the intersection of reinforcement learning, trustworthy AI, generative AI, and robotics. I am passionate about designing robust and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for **Trustworthy Automated Decision-Making Agents**.

I received my Master's degree (Control Science and Engineering) in 2019 from the [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Tao Zhang](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1110/1573.htm). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees (Automation & Mathematics) in 2016 from the [Shen Yuan Honors College](https://hc.buaa.edu.cn) (formerly School of Advanced Engineering) at [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn).
